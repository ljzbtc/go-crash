### Projects

(To be added)

## Review of Basics

Total study time: 12 days * 40 minutes = 480 minutes (8 hours)

### Pros of Official Go Tour:

1. Comprehensive coverage of Go syntax
2. Concise and focused lessons
3. Interactive coding environment
4. Well-structured progression of topics
5. Excellent for experienced programmers learning Go

### Cons of Official Go Tour:

1. May be too fast-paced for absolute beginners
2. Limited depth on advanced topics
3. Few real-world application examples

### Learning Experience:

1. Gained a comprehensive understanding of Go syntax
2. Developed initial grasp of generics and concurrency in Go
3. Found Go's syntax relatively easy to learn
4. High-quality content, ideal for coders with prior programming experience

### Next Steps:

I plan to deepen my understanding of Go and its ecosystem by:

1. Implementing components from go-eth and op-node
2. Gaining in-depth knowledge of Go, EVM, and Layer 2 solutions

This approach will allow me to apply Go in real-world blockchain scenarios and further enhance my skills in both Go programming and blockchain technology.
